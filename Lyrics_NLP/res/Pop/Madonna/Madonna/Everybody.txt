
 I know you've been waiting, yeah
 I've been watching you, yeah
 I know you want to get up, yeah
 Come on

 Everybody, come on, dance and sing
 Everybody, get up and do your thing
 Everybody, come on, dance and sing
 Everybody, get up and do your thing


 Let the music take control
 Find a groove and let yourself go
 When the room begins to sway
 You know what I'm trying to say
 Come on, take a chance
 Get up and start the dance
 Let the D.J. shake you
 Let the music take you

 Let your body take a ride
 Feel the beat and step inside
 Music makes the world go around
 You can turn your troubles upside down
 Going to have to change your mind
 Going to leave your troubles behind
 Your body gets the notion
 When your feet can make the motion


 Dance and sing, get up and do your thing 
 Dance and sing, get up and do your thing 
 Dance and sing, get up and do your thing 


 I know you've been waiting, yeah, yeah
 I see you sitting there, I've been watching you
 Across the room, yeah, yeah
 I've been watching you, I see you sitting there by yourself
 Yeah, yeah
 Come on, come on, come on


 Let the music take control
 Find a groove and let yourself go
 When the room begins to sway
 You know what I'm trying to say
