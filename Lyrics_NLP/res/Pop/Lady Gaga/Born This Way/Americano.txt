I met a girl in east L.A.
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two-barrio chords
We fell in love, but not in court (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

I don't sp', I don't sp'
Ah ah ah ah ah America Americano, ah ah ah ah ah America Americano

Mis canciones son de la re-revolución
Mi corazón me duele por mi generación
If you love me we can marry on the west coast
On a Wednesday en el verano en agosto

I don't speak your, I don't speak your language, oh no (la-la-la-la-la-la-la))
I don't speak your, I won't speak your, won't speak
Your Jesús Cristo (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Ah ah ah ah ah America Americano, ah ah ah ah ah America Americano

I will fight for, I have fought for how I love you (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
I have cried for, I will die for how I care (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
In the mountains, las campanas están sonando (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Todos los chicos (chicas) y los chicos (chicas) están besando (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

I don't speak your, I don't speak your language, oh no (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesús Cristo (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I don't speak your Americano (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesús Cristo (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Ah ah ah ah ah America Americano, ah ah ah ah ah America Americano
Ah ah ah ah ah America Americano, ah ah ah ah ah America Americano

Don't you try to catch me, don't you try to catch me
No, no, no, no I'm living on the edge of
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law

Don't you try to catch me, don't you try to catch me
No, no, no, no don't you try to catch me
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law
