It's like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right out of the blue
Every time I see you, every time I see you

Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you, every time I see you

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you

I wanna tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you, every time I see you

I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard
Would love a good break but they feel it too
Every time I see you, why I gotta see you?

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like a early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you, yeah

Oh, you're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you
Every time I see you, oh yeah

Oh, I'm walking down the street
And you walk right up to me and I freeze
Every time I see you
