It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed to everybody 
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned
And two nights from then

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
I did it again

I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate
Told myself I'd had enough
Then like a real man
I took hold of that can, and 

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
I did it again

I guess I'm a slow learner, I ought to know better
Than to do what I do, but I ain't no quitter

The other night we got a little rowdy
I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah things got out of hand at that party
I said that's it, it's 'bout time I grow up
But that next weekend, I called all my friends and

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
Yeah what any old country boy'd do
I did it again, I did it again
