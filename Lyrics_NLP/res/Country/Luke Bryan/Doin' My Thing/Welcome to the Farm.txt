We've been up here in this city
Livin' in the grease and grime
Girl, it's a doggone pity
We ain't been gettin' anytime

I've been preachin' 'bout back home
How it can make you feel so alive
Tell you what we can do
Baby, let's me and you take a little drive

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

There ain't no card in your pocket
If we're gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everythin' around here
That's just the way it's been for so long

How'd you like a coke from a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

That straw in your hair
Not an ounce of makeup on you
As the sun goes down
Girl, I ain't never seen you lookin' so good
As you do right now

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

Right there's and old step side
How 'bout that blue sky?
So pretty it'll make you cry
(Welcome to the farm)

We can roll on over yonder
Or sit right here and ponder
Watch the wind whirl by

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
