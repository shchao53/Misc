Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have

Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along

Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're gonna pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kinda funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the track
And when that sun goes down
And there ain't no goin' back

Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along

Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along

Keep chuggin' along
