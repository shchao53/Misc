Time is tight and money is short
River's up and the weatherman
He's calling for another storm

Pressure's on, the margins thin
Gotta figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh mama, what am I gonna do?
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything, pray about everything

Love is blind, fate don't care
Lose your grip and your balloons go sailing off into the air
Oh mama, what am I gonna do?
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything, yeah, pray about everything

Yeah, take a walk, take a breath, oh, give it all a rest
Take a cane pole to the fishing hole and catch a couple of fish
And just like that, toss 'em back and make a little wish
Yeah, yeah

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout it
Stress 'bout it, fret 'bout it

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything, yeah, pray about everything
