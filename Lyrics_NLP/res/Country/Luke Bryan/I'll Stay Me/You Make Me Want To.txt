You make me want to hold you like a hammock on a summer day 
Tell you how I'm gonna take your cares away
You make me want to
You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town 
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you 'til you feel the truth
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

Well I never met a girl like you
That's got me thinking like I do
To hang up my hat and kick off my boots
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to
