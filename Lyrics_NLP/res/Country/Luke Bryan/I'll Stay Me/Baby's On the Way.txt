I ain't been doin' too right, since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast, lost at work state of mind
We're meetin' here because, she mentioned that she loves
Some kinda sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff
And I'm feelin' out of place, but baby's on the way

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy, my hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she's got, got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool and end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way

Ain't gonna try those lines, been used so many times
Like, "When you fell from heaven, did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just gonna wear this smile, sit back and talk a while
Pull a few questions from my get to know her better file
Hey, it's a real good day 'cause baby's on the way

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy, my hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got, got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool and end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way, oh yeah, yeah

It's just a simple case of can't wait
Gonna be great to see her again
Gonna be tough to hide what's inside
And in my eyes when she walks in

Oh, I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy, my hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got, got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool and end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way

Hey, yeah, my baby's on the way, yeah, yeah
Baby's on the way
