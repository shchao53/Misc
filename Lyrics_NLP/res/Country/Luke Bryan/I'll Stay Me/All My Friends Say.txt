I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rockin' chair
Holdin' a beer in my hand
Sportin' a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Don't have a clue what went down
So I started callin' around

And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I found my billfold
I cried oh no, no
Good time Charlie got me
Now I'm broke
But it was worth actin' like a fool
Yeah, girl, I must really showed you

Cuz all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles when you walk in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seein' you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was Elvis rockin'
On the bar
Workin' the crowd
Pourin' out my heart


And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my 
(All my)
All my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what all my friends say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what all my friends say
