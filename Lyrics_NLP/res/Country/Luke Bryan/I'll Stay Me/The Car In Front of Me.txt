Homecoming parade, you were the queen
I was riding right behind you with the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger as you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer could ever be so proud

The car in front of me was carrying what i loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

On Wednesday nights, we'd meet at church
You'd bring the kids, and I'd come straight from work
Going home I'd read their lips through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me, I thought God I'm a lucky man

The car in front of me was carrying what i loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

Even after what the doctor said
You were strong and you believed
And you held us all together through one more spring

Their little hands held on to mine
As we sat in that backseat with tears in our eyes
A long line of headlights
Strangers stopped along the road
No Monday wasn't meant for wearing Sunday clothes

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
