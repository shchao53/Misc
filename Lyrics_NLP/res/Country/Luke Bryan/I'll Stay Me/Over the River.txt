There's a bonfire burning. 
Got Bocephus blaring louder than allowed out in our neck of the neighborhood.
If you wanna see follow me over the river through the woods. 

When the bugs and the beer start biting 
Theres bound to be some friendly fighting
Usually little Becky Lee winds up jumpin up on somebodys hood
Don't she dance good?
Join the crowd gather round
Over the river through the woods. 

Just follow my tail lights out past the streetlights a left then a hard right 
They're goin all night
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doin what we should. 
Over the river and through the woods

At first I thought she was kiddin when she mentioned skinny dipping.
She said follow me through the trees yes siree unless I misunderstood. 
We'll splash and splish with the fish over the river and through the woods. 

Thats my beer can next to her beer can next to my work pants up there on dry land. 
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doin what we should. 
Over the river and through the woods. 

Thats my sore head layin in my truck bed eyes blood shot red hearing what my mamma said. 
But we did a little what we want after one long week of doing what we should. 
over the river and through the woods.
