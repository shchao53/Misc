Ridin' down the road, listening to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby, this is it, the one I wanted you to hear
Don't it sound just like us?"

Up 'til then all I'd ever listened to was
'A Little Sweet Home', 'Tuesday's Gone' and 'Workin' Man Blues'

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words, first time I sang along
Whenever it comes on I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on, my first love song

Baby, I'm not who I was
You gave me your love and it woke me up
Made me more aware of something deep inside
Something that I have, a life I wanna share

And I'll remember this as long as I live
Every note, every word, every single kiss

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words, first time I sang along
Whenever it comes on I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on, my first love song

Baby, this is my first love song
First time I felt the words, first time I sang along
Whenever it comes on I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on, my first love song
Yeah, baby, my first love song
