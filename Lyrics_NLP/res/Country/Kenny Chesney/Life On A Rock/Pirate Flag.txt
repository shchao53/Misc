Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town,
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around.
Moonshine, that's where they make it,
Put it in a jug, makes you wanna get naked.
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line.
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willin' and able
Don't know what makes you say "What the hell"
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just wanna dance
And she loves to dance

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl
Pirate flag and an island girl

Well I remember back home 'neath the big ol' moon
Tucked back in the woods, yea life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinkin' shooting stars

I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
