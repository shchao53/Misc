All he could think about was I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell I'm just a kid myself
How'm I gonna raise one

All he could see were his dreams goin' up in smoke
So much for ditchin' this town and hangin' out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone

And he said
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all good-bye
There goes my life

A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah
He loves that little girl

Momma's waiting to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncin' curls

He smiles
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, daddy good-night
There goes my life

She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes and his American Express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood, said you're good to go
She hugged them both and headed off to the West Coast

And he cried
There goes my life
There goes my future
My everything
I love you
Baby good-bye

There goes my life
There goes my life
Baby good-bye
