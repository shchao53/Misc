Take off all the makeup girl
Shine your light, show the world
Don't be shy, don't be scared
You don't have to hide under there
Let's throw away all the magazines
Turn off the static on the TV
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you

Yeah
La la la la la

Mirror mirror on the wall
Acting like he knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity
He doesn't care what's underneath
All hung up on the negative
Doesn't have to be the way it is
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you

Free as a bird,
Up on a watch
Just like a flower growing wild
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you

Oh you're free as a bird up on a wire
Just like a flower growing wild, just like a flower growing wild
