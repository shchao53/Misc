This ain't comin' from no prophet 
Just an ordinary man 
When I close my eyes I see 
The way this world shall be 
When we all walk hand in hand 

When the last child cries for a crust of bread 
When the last man dies for just words that he said 
When there's shelter over the poorest head 
We shall be free 

When the last thing we notice is the color of skin 
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within 
When the skies and the oceans are clean again 
Then we shall be free 

We shall be free 
We shall be free 
Stand straight, walk proud 
'Cause we shall be free 
When we're free to love anyone we choose 
When this world's big enough for all different views 
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew 
Then we shall be free 
We shall be free 

We shall be free 
Have a little faith 
Hold out 
'Cause we shall be free 

And when money talks for the very last time 
And nobody walks a step behind 
When there's only one race and that's mankind 
Then we shall be free 

We shall be free 
We shall be free 
Stand straight, walk proud, have a little faith, hold out 
We shall be free 

We shall be free 
We shall be free 
Stand straight, have a little faith 

We shall be free
