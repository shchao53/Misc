There's not a lot of things to do 
I wouldn't rather do with you 
Guess I'm funny that way 

Lately I just sit and stare 
I talk to people who aren't there 
To get through one night a day 
One night a day 
One step away 

From leavin' you behind 
I sit up with the radio 
Sing along with the ones I know 
To get through one night a day 
One night a day 
One step away 

From leavin' you behind 
I'm callin' every friend I've had 
Wake 'em up, and make 'em mad 
Let 'em know that I'm OK 
I used to sit and talk to you 
They're all just a substitute 
To get through one night a day 
One night a day 
One step away 

From leavin' you behind 
I stay up with the late, late show 
Just another way I know 
To get through one night a day 
To get through one night a day
