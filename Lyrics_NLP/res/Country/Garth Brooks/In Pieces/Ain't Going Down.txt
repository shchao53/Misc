Six o'clock on Friday evening 
Momma doesn' t know she's leaving 
'Til she hears the screen door slamming 
Rubber squealin', gears a-jamming 
Local country station just a blaring on the radio 
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo 
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning 
Girl you better get your red head 
Back in bed before the morning 

Nine o'clock the show is ending 
But the fun is just beginning 
She knows he's anticipating 
But she's gonna keep him waiting 
Grab a bite to eat 
And then they're heading to the honkey tonk 
But loud crowds and line dancing 
Just ain't what they really want 
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek 
And where it's George Strait 'til real late 
And dancing cheek to cheek 

Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up 
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough 
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck 
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up 

Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing 
Midnight starts the hard romancing 
One o'clock that truck is rocking 
Two is coming, still no stopping 
Break to check the clock at three 
They're right on where they want to be 
Four o'clock get up and going 
Five o'clock that rooster's crowing 

Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up 
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough 
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck 
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up 

Six o'clock on Saturday 
Her folks don't know he's on his way 
The stalls are clean, the horses fed 
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead 
Well here he comes around the bend 
Slowing down, she's jumping in 
Hey mom, you're daughter's gone 
And there they go again 

Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up 
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough 
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck 
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
