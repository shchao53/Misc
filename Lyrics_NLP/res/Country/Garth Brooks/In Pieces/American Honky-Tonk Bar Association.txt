If your paycheck depends on 
The weather and the clock 
If your conversation calls for 
A little more than a coffee pot 
If you need to pour your heart out 
And try to rectify some situation 
That you're facing 
Contact your American Honky-Tonk Bar Association 

When Uncle Sam dips in your pocket 
For most things you don't mind 
But when your dollar goes to all of those 
Standing in a welfare line 
Well rejoice you have a voice 
If you're concerned about the destination 
Of this great nation 
It's called the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association 

It represents the hardhat 
Gunrack, achin'-back 
Over taxed, flag-wavin', fun-lovin' crowd 
They're heart is in the music 
And they love to play it loud 
There's no forms or applications 
There's no red tape administrations 
It's the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association 

We're all one big family 
Throughout the cities and the towns 
We don't reach for handouts 
we reach for those who are down 
And every local chapter has a seven day a week 
Available consultation 
For your frustration 
It's called the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association 

It represents the mud flaps 
Six pack, beer crack 
Over-taxed, flag-wavin', fun-lovin' crowd 
They're heart is in the music 
And they love to play it loud 
There's no forms or applications 
There's no red tape administrations 
It's the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association
