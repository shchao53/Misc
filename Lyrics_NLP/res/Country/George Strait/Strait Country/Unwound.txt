Give me a bottle,
Of your very best,
Cause I've got a problem
I'm gonna drink off my chest.
I'm gonna spend the night,
Gettin' down,
Cause that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.

That woman that I had wrapped around my
Finger just a come unwound,
She kicked my out of the house and 
Tonight I'm whiskey bound.
Well I'm gonna be,
The drunkest fool in town,
Cause that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.

Well she packed my bags,
And opened up the door,
And I got a feelin she didnt want me around no more.
She caught me in a lie,
When I was messin around,
And that woman that I had 
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.

That woman that I had wrapped around my
Finger just a come unwound,
She kicked my out of the house and 
Tonight I'm whiskey bound.
Well I'm gonna be,
The drunkest fool in town,
Cause that woman that i had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
Just a come unwound

And that woman that I had 
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
