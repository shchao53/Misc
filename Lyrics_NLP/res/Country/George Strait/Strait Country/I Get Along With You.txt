I don't get along
With people who aren't kind
I don't get along
With folks with only money on their mind
And I don't get along with someone
Who's always trying to tell me what to do
But on and on
I get along with you

Well, I don't like
People always telling me that I should change
They get simple lives
For them to think they've got my life to rearrange
But they don't understand
Exactly what love boils down to
'Cause on and on (On and on)
I get along with you

Well all it takes to please me
Is waking in the morning feeling you by my side
And all I ever needed
Is knowing that I'm needed in your life

I may not do
All the things that other people want me to
But on and on (On and on)
I'll get along with you
Yeah, on and on (On and on)
I get along with you...
