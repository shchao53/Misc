I love the sound of a jukebox playing, 
So I sit here while she's staying home 
Watching Dallas on TV 
I love the taste of whiskey straight, 
But the strongest thing she ever takes is a sip
From a small glass of Chablis. 
Though birds of a different feather, 
Our love keeps us together, 
And she knows what's wrong with me tonight, 

I've got that Friday night fever; 
Sometimes a man just needs a breather. 
She knows I love her and I need her. 
And I'm no cheater, 
I've just got that Friday night fever. 

She wouldn't change me if she could, 
So I wouldn't change her, she's too good. 
Sometimes a man just needs a change of pace. 
I've heard all those come-on lines, 
But I go home at closing time. 
I know no one could ever take her place 
Now she's taking down her hair, 
She knows I'll soon be there 
To give her the love she needs tonight. 

I've got that Friday night fever; 
Sometimes a man just needs a breather. 
She knows I love her and I need her. 
And I'm no cheater, 
I've just got that Friday night fever.

I got that Friday night fever;
Sometimes a man just needs a breather. 
She knows I love her and I need her. 
And I'm no cheater, 
I've just got that Friday night fever...
