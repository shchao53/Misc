I let it all hang out last night
Come in hung over this morning
My woman met me at the door
Preaching me this warning
She said "You're gonna have to change
Your sinful way of living"
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven

Well I promised to go to church with her
About a month of Sundays ago
And here it is, it's Sunday again
And I ain't been once in a row
And everytime that old church bell rings
You can hear my rod and reel singing
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven

She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven
'Cause there ain't no way
All my sins could be forgiven
There's only Ten Commandments
But I broke at least eleven
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven

She went out and bought me
A Sunday go-meeting suit
And I must confess it looked pretty sharp
With my old hunting boots
But I wore holes in both the knees
Trying to roll them sevens
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven

She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven...
