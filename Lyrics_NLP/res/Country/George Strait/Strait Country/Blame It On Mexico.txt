In a bar in Acuna called Mah Crosby's
I found myself not feeling any pain
I told a Frisco girl I'd come for freedom
She said she'd only come to catch a train
We struck up some idle conversation
Traded all the troubles on our minds
One thing led to another in the evening
And I fell in love again for my last time

Blame it on Mexico
If You need a reason
Say it's too much guitar music, tequila, salt, and lime
Blame it on Mexico
But she's the reason
That I fell in love again for my last time

Daylight dawned and found me in DelRio
In a run down motel room as dark as hell
I felt all the pains of a morning after
And all alone as far as I could tell
Why she left, I have no way of knowing
Guess she cought her train, and that's a crime
She took everything I ever wanted
And i fell in love again for my last time

Blame it on Mexico
If you need a reason
Say it's too much guitar music, tequila, salt, and lime
Blame it on Mexico
But she's the reason
That I fell in love again for my last time
