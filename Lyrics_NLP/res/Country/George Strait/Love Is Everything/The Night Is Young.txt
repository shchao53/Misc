There's a little place I know
Right down the road
They call a hideaway
They party night and day
Girl, I think that it's high time
That you and I cut loose, unwind
It's time to play
Oh, it's Friday
The night is young and the sun's been down a long time

It's half-past a half-full glass
And since you asked
We're gonna dance the night
Right into broad daylight
You know it'd be worth our while
So, give me that come get me smile
You know the one, mmm
And I'll come undone
The night is young but the sun's been down a long time

It's been awhile since that old sun departed
Let's take our time and finish what we started
The night is young, the sun's been down a long time

Let's throw ourselves a night to remember
'Til there's nothing left of this place but burning embers
The night is young but the sun's been down a long time

I love to see you, let your hair down
Throw your arms 'round
Me, look in my eyes
And let your laughter fly
All week long, I've waited on
My chance to hold you all night long
And it's here girl
Baby, rock my world
The night is young but the sun's been down a long time

Let's Throw ourselves a night to remember
'Til there's nothing left of this place but burning embers
The night is young but the sun's been down a long time
Oh, the night is young but the sun has been down a long time
