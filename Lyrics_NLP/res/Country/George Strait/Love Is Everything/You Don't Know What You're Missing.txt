Sittin' at the bar I overheard a couple guys, one was complaining
About his life and his wife and everyday things
Said, his kids were getting' big and getting' hard to handle
The other guy was sipping whiskey, wasn't saying a thing

The first guy kept talking for what seemed like forever
Said, I never have money or time like I used to
He went on and on, till the second guy finally sat down his whiskey 
Looked him straight in the eye and said, lucky you.

You don't know what it feels like living this lonely
You don't know what it sounds like when nobody's home
You've been talking and man, I've been doing some listening
You don't know what you're missing, till it's gone

The second guy said, I used to have all your problems
But hindsight's 20/20 and a fool is blind
So, please excuse me if I have to end our conversation
And forgive me if I can't sympathize

You don't know what it feels like living this lonely
You don't know what it sounds like when nobody's home
You've been talking and man, I've been doing some listening
You don't know what you're missing, till it's gone

You don't know what you're missing till it's gone
