She's gotta body like a hundred dollar bill
soft as satin, smooth as silk
And to top all that, she's got a heart to match

I could do a lot worse I know
I'd be a damn fool to let her go
Shouldn't be a doubt
Still here I am

Sittin' on a stool, sitting' on the fence
Tryin' to play it cool, tryin' to talk some sense
Into this crazy heart, lookin' for a sign
Do I let her go or do I make her mine
While there's still a chance
Sittin' on a stool, sitting' on the fence

Guess I should probably settle up and head for the door
MAybe I'll just stay and have one more
to calm my nerves
one more can't hurt

Truth is I don't know what she sees in me
She says, I'm all she'll ever want or need
On God's green earth, but one more can't hurt

Sittin' on a stool, sitting' on the fence
Tryin' to play it cool, tryin' to talk some sense
Into this crazy heart, lookin' for a sign
Do I let her go or do I make her mine
While there's still a chance
Sittin' on a stool, sitting' on the fence

Do I run to her and tell her she's the one
Or do I do just like I've always done

Sittin' on a stool, sitting' on the fence
Tryin' to play it cool, tryin' to talk some sense
Into this crazy, mixed-up heart of mine
Do I let her go or do I make her mine
While there's still a chance
Sittin' on a stool, sittin' on the fence
Sittin' on a stool, sittin' on the fence
