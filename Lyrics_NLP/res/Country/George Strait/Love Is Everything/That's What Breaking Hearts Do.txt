You try and try to erase
That lonely look on your face
You try and try to pretend
Soon it's all gonna end
You cry a few more tears
Into a few more beers
The days turn to weeks
And the weeks feel like years

That's what breaking hearts do
That's what breaking hearts do
They cause you so much pain
Make you go insane
That's what breaking hearts do

Every time you try to walk
in circles you walk
Every time you try to talk
In circles you talk
You can't think straight
Your mind starts to spin
You can try to fight it
But you know you can't win

Feel like your hands are tied
Bound up, strapped down, busted inside
Don't have the will to find your way
And you don't think you can take it even one more day

Feel like your hands are tied
Bound up, strapped down, busted inside
Don't have the will to find your way
And you don't think you can take it even one more day

they keep you looking out your window
they keep you checking your phone
You hear a sound at your door
You walk across that floor
But you're still there all alone

That's what breaking hearts do
That's what breaking hearts do
They cause you so much pain
Make you go insane
That's what breaking hearts do

They cause you so much pain
They make you go insane
That's what breaking hearts do.
