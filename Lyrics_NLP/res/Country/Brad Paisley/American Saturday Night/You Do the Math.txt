With seven billion people in this world,
I can't believe your still a single girl,
I bet you're thinking you're better off on your own,
But the best things in life,
Just can't be done alone.

It takes two to make love baby,
I'm sure of that,
I'm one, you're one,
You do the math.

Being single has been kinda fun,
But I can see you with me ridin' shotgun,
I'll take you baby anywhere you wanna go,
And together we can have more fun than we can have alone.

It takes two to make love baby,
I'm sure of that,
I'm one, you're one,
You do the math.

I ain't never been a number's guy, but sure enough,
I look into your eyes and all adds up.

It takes two to make love baby,
I'm sure of that,
I'm one, you're one,
You do the math.

I'm one, you're one,
You do the math.
