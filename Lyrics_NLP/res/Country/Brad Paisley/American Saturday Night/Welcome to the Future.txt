When I was ten years old
I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were goin' on an eight hour drive
If I could just watch TV
And I'd-a given anything
To have my own Pac-Man game at home
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade
And now I've got it on my phone

Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the future

My grandpa was in World War II
He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines
I wish they could see this now
The world they saved has changed, you know
'Cause I was on a video chat this morning
With a company in Tokyo

Hey, every day's a revolution
Welcome to the future

(Hey) Look around, it's all so clear
(Hey) Wherever we were goin', well we're here
(Hey) So many things I never thought I'd see
Happening right in front of me

I had a friend in school
Running back on the football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the homecoming queen
I thought about him today
And everybody who's seen what he's seen
From a woman on a bus
To a man with a dream

Hey, wake up Martin Luther
Welcome to the future

Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the future
