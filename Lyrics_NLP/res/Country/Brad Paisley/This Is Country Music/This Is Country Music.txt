You're not supposed to say the word "cancer" in a song. 
And tellin' folks Jesus is the answer can rub 'em wrong. 
It ain't hip to sing about tractors, trucks, little towns, and mama, yeah that might be true. 
But this is country music and we do 

Do you like to drink a cold one on the weekend and get a little loud? 
Do you wanna say I'm sorry or I love ya but you don't know how? 
Do you wish somebody had the nerve to tell that stupid boss of yours
to shove it next time he yells at you? 
Well this is country music and we do 

So turn it on, turn it up, and sing a long 
This is real; this is your life in a song 
Yeah this is country music. 

Are you haunted by the echo of your mother on the phone 
Cryin as she tells you that your brother is not coming home? 
And if there's anyone that still has pride and the memory of those
that died defending the old red, white, and blue, 

This is country music and we do 

So turn it on, turn it up, and sing a long 
This is real; this is your life in a song 
Just like a road that takes you home 
Yeah this is right where you belong 
This is country music 
This is country music 
He Stop Lovin Her Today 
Hello Darlin' 
God Bless the USA 
Amarillo by Morning 
Stand by your Man 
Take Me Home 
I Walk the Line 
Country Boy Can Survive
