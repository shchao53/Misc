She'd rather wear a pair of cut-off jeans than a fancy evening dress,
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she's a hot southern mess...
She'll take a beer over white wine and a campfire over candle light,
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night...

Is listenin' to old Alabama, drivin' through Tennessee...
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night,
And she can't keep her hands off of me-ee-eee!

And now we're rollin' down an old back road,
I got the steering wheel in one hand...
We'll find a hideaway where she and I can play,
In Mother Nature's band...

Now we're listenin' to old Alabama, parked somewhere in Tennessee...
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right,
And It's Love In The First Degree-ee-eee!

Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane, or some ol' Righteous Brothers song,

And Barry White ain't gonna work tonight, if you really wanna turn her on;
Play some back home come on music that comes from the heart,
Play something with lots of feeling, 'cause that's where music has to start...

Now we're listenin' to Old Alabama, and we're drivin' through Tennessee,
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right and its Love in the First Degree...

Yeah' you know we're listenin' to Old Alabama,(old Alabama) drivin' through Tennessee, (Tennessee)
A little Why Lady Why at The Right Time of The Night
Oh and she can't keep her hands off of me-ee-eee

Oh, play me some old Alabama,
Oh, play me some old Alabama...
Won't you play me some old Alabama,
Play me some old Alabama...
Won't you pla-ee-ay-ay
