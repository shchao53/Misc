Life is like a mountain railway
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch for curves and hills and valleys
Never falter never fail
And keep your hands upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's praise forevermore

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the Union Depot
Into which your train will glide
There you'll meet the Superintendent
God, the Father, God, the Son

With a hearty joyous greeting
Weary pilgrim, welcome home

Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's praise forevermore

Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's praise forevermore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's praise forevermore

So turn it on, turn it up
And sing along
