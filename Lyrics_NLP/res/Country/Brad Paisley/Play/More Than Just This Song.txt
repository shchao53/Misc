Like a boat on a river this bus is floating down this old highway 
Looking out the window I think about how I got here today 
Anyone who's anywhere had some help getting there its true 
And one of the reasons why I get to do the things I do 

I met this angel 
With callused hands 
Who led this boy to his band 
Under his wing I learned to fly 
On these 6 strings through this life 
You can hear them in my playing 
Although he's gone 
And I owe him so much more than just this song. 

Like a leaf that had fallen I was drifting down the stream 
Mr. Guitar came into my life and let me live this dream 
His old gretch still speaking still speaking its teaching all of us a ton 
He was my friend and my hero all wrapped up in one 

I met this angel 
With callused hands 
Who lead this naive boy into his band 
Under his wing I learned to fly 
On his 6 strings into the night 
I can still hear him playing although he's gone 
And I owe him so much more than just this song. 

Every face we see from we every stage we roll 
With every note we play even though there gone 
They live on 
They live on
