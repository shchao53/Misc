(feat. B.B. King)

Hey everybody, let's have fun
You only live but once and when you're dead you're done
You better let the good time roll, baby, oh, let's get it own mama
And I don't care if you're old now
Get yourself together and let the good time roll

Don't sit there mumbling, talkin' trash
If you want to have a ball you got to go out, spend some cash
L-l-let the good times roll, babe, oh baby, oh baby
And I don't care if you're old now, get together and let the good time roll

Hey y'all tell everybody, Ray Charles' in town
Got a dollar and a quarter and I'm just ringing the clock now
Don't let nobody, play me cheap
I got fifty cents more than I'm gonna keep

I'm gonna let the good times roll now, oh baby, oh baby
And I don't care if you're old now, get together and let the good time roll

Hey no matter whether, rainy weather
If you want to have a ball you got to get yourself together
Oh, get yourself under control
Ohh, yeah, oh
