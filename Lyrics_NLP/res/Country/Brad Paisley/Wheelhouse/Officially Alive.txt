So you ruffled some feathers, yeah, you've done it now
Turned the tables in the temple clean upside down
You're out on a ledge and one things for sure
When you've got em all wishin you'd never been born

Congratulations, you are officially alive
Its confirmation you are officially alive

Its not the double kick of an ultrasound
Or a piece of paper on file downtown
It takes more than a beat and a breath and a name
Its when you're so in love and so in pain

Congratulations, you are officially alive
Heres affirmation, you are officially alive

Yeah, its a tragedy to go through history and simply just exist
You're gonna realize how quick it flies by and everything you missed
And suddenly you're standing there in scrubs
Love has found new flesh and blood
Its a feeling you weren't ready for
When you're lookin in eyes that look like yours

Congratulations, you are officially alive
This is creation, you are officially alive
You are officially alive
