I had a heart attack
(He had a heart attack)
While I was playing charades
Everybody yelled
"Heart attack!"
(Pledge of allegiance)
But it was too late

Harvey Bodine
Died, died at 11:09
And he left behind
A miserable wife
And at 11:14
His heart came back on the screen
Thanks to that defib machine
He came back to life

Oh but those five minutes were heaven
A peace unlike he'd ever known
And as he came back to the living
He thought "Please God, don't make me go
Back to life"

They told him what happened
How that green line had flattened
Oh, Harvey just started laughing
He said, "You're telling me I died"
(You're telling me I died?)

Aw, and he thought about that woman
How she treated him for years
All the yellin' and the screamin'
And the nagging and the tears
And the way it wasn't really all that bad
When he lost his life

Because those five minutes were heaven
A peace unlike he'd ever known
And now he was back with the living
And he found himself reaching for the phone

He called his lawyer, he called his priest
Told 'em bout how they'd restarted his heart
And how his wedding vows were technically
'Til death do us part

You'll probably judge me and so be it
But you know boys, here's how I see it

Harvey Bodine
Died, died at 11:09
And he left behind
A miserable wife
Oh, but at 11:14
My heart came back on that screen
Thanks to that defib machine
I've come back to life
