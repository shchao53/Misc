When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton, 
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shocking 

Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea 
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans 
Not everybody goes to church or watches every NASCAR race 
Not everybody knows the words to "Ring of Fire" or "Amazing Grace" 

Oh, Dixie Land, 
I hope you understand 
When I miss my Tennessee home 
And I been away way too long 
I can't see this world unless I go 
Outside my Southern comfort zone 

I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands 
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand 
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night 
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern lights 
I know what it's like to meet the only one like me, 
To take a good hard look around and be a minority 

And I miss my Tennessee home 
I can see the ways that I grown 
I can't see this world unless I go 
Outside my Southern comfort zone 

I miss your biscuits and your gravy 
Fireflies dancing in the night 
You have fed me and saved me 
Billy Graham and Martha White 

I have since become a gypsy 
And I just can't wait to pack 
'Cause I know the route I leave on 
It will always bring me back 

I wish I was in Dixie again 
I miss my Tennessee home 
I've been away way too long 
I can't see this world unless I go 
Outside my Southern comfort zone 

Look away, look away 

Oh, Dixie Land, 
I hope you understand 
When I miss my Tennessee home 
And I been away way too long 
I can't see this world unless I go 
Outside my Southern comfort zone 
I wish I was in Dixie, away, look away
