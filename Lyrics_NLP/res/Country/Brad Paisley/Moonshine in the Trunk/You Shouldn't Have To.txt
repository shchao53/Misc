You've got this confidence
Yeah it was obvious
The way you walked in here
You look sensational
And totally capable
Of buying your own beer
But you shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to

I hate to think about
Everything you've done without
Or how it's been before
You've ever walked home alone
Or sat and waited by the phone
Or opened your own door
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to

Do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true?
A girl like you can do anything
But anything you don't wanna do
You shouldn't have to
Girl, you shouldn't have to

Hear me now, that's what I'm saying
And another thing, tell me now

Ever longed for a back rub
All alone in your bathtub?
Need your glass of wine topped off
But you'd have to get out and dry off, aw
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to

Do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true?
A girl like you can do anything
But anything you don't wanna do

Like wash your own car or bait your own hook
Get all made up, wonder how you look
Make your own breakfast, make the first move
Feel like you ain't being listened to
Kill your own spiders, change your flat tire
Stoke your own fire, mow your own grass
Pump your own gas, ever feel pain
Wish you had a ring on your hand, feel like anything less
Than the best lookin' thing this town's ever seen
Have a dress you'd love to wear but you gotta wait
Cause there ain't nobody there to help you zip the thing
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to
