She left without leaving a number 
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year 
Before she called him up,
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If your calling 'bout the car, I sold it,
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling
If you got something to sell
Your wasting your time 
I'm not buying
If it's anybody else 
Wait for the tone 
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin 
I still love you.

The telephone fell to the counter 
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kinda man would hang on that long 
What kinda love that must be
She waited three days 
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say 
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night, 
I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake 
And I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back
When I get home 
On Sunday afternoon,
And P.S. if this is Austin 
I still love you

This time she left her number 
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone 
On Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart
It's still yours 
I shoulda listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have 
Taken me so long 
To know where I belong
And by the way boy 
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
...I still love you
