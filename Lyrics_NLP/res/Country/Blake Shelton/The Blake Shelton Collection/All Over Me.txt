There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd I used to pull away
When she would kiss my face and touch my hair
She didn't care who saw

She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
Now to prove that I love her
I crawl on my knees
For the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me

The sky is blue
But from where I stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What I wouldn't give if I could feel the familiar touch
Of her love holding me'again

She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
Now to prove that I love her
I crawl on my knees
For the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me

She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
Now to prove that I love her
I crawl on my knees
For the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
