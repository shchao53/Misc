If I could I would dare
Feed your dreams and starve your fears
If I could light the world, we could sit and watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, uh huh

If I could take you in, feeling you deep beneath my skin
Then I could slip away with you as a poison in my veins
But I don't wanna fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I've died without the one

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, uh huh

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, uh huh

If I could I would dare
Feed your dreams and starve your fears
