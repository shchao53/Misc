Ever since you left me I've been ridin' 'round
Crankin' up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears I don't know how
Much more missin' you I can take
I pray pray prayed, for a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

I take a shot of 'I don't care what you doing now'
Chase that one with a cold 'Screw you'
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of 'Someone new'
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar bar bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart heart heart

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

When we were together
I thought life was set forever
Even though I knew better that the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn gets kissed
By the daybreak got down on my knees and I
Prayed, prayed, prayed, for a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel
