Don't waste your time
Looking over your shoulder
Those loves from the past
Ain't a gettin' no closer

When I look at my future
You're all I can see
So honey, don't go loving on
Nobody but me

Nobody but me
Gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me
Gonna cry if you up and leave

Now you can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please
Honey don't go loving on
Nobody but me

I took my time
To tell you how I feel
Just because I took so long
Don't mean that it isn't real

Now I ain't got no diamond
But I'm down on my knees
So honey don't go loving on
Nobody but me

Nobody but me
Gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me
Gonna cry if you up and leave

Now you can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please
Honey don't go loving on
Nobody but me

Nobody but me
Gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me
Gonna cry if you up and leave

Now you can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please
Honey don't go loving on
Nobody but me

Don't go loving on
Nobody but me
