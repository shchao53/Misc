Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign-car-driving dude
With a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone

He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and warm breeze is blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

I circled the parking lot
Trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar
Was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up

But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

Some beach, somewhere 
There's nowhere to go when you've got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot senoritas
Smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

Well, I sat in that waiting room
Seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said Doc's ready for you
Your not gonna feel a thing
We'll give you some novacaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two

But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

Some beach, somewhere
There a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere
